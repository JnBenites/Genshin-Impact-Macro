Keqing Attack Macro for Thunderclap and Slash Damage

May not work on all terrain, will not work if affected by Cryo, as atk spd is slower

For Logitech Mice:
  Open setting.json in "C:\Users\(Username)\AppData\Local\LGHUB\settings.json"
  Scroll down until the first "attribute": "MACRO_PLAYBACK"
  Paste the code before the { above the "applicationId":
      (Paste code here)
       {
        "applicationId": "Application ID",
        "attribute": "MACRO_PLAYBACK",



For AHK Script, run as Administrator, tune the values under Camera Reset Time and Charged Atk Time. Charged Atk Time should be as low as possible but still trigger Thunderclap, and Camera Reset Time should be as low as possible but still can do charged attacks. 
Default Values: 720, 667
