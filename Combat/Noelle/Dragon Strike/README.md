Dragon Strike Attack for Noelle

Caution: Macro use may result in a ban.

This macro only targets Noelle, other characters may not work. Currently is very inconsistent.

Version No Plunge does not come with automatic plunge attacks after step-up.

For AHK script, run as Administrator. Change Hotkey key to any key you would use. Default: `/~. Swing Time should be as low as possible, but still be large enough for the macro to consistantly climb.

For most consistency, activate macro after first strike with auto-attack. Logitech Macro is inconsistant.
